Landmarks Readme
================

Ever read a source code listing or lengthy comment thread and wished for a quick means of bookmarking a particular function or comment to refer to later? Landmarks is a bookmarklet seeking to provide that very service.

The project's concept is outlined at <http://clusterify.com/projects/list/fsavard/7/>. You are encouraged to join, even if you only contribute feedback.
